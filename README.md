# sass-starter

Just a simple set of starter files to get up and running quick to do basic css/js stuff using SASS and BrowserSync.

## Getting Started

### 1) Install
Run `npm install` in your project directory.

### 2) Start Gulp
Run `gulp watch` in your project directory.

Your default browser should open up the **index.html** page.

If it doesn't load automatically, check your terminal for the **localhost** address.

### 3) Edit away
Edit the the **index.html**, **scss/app.scss** and **js/script.js**.

Any saved changes should automatically be reflected in your browser.

NOTE: The css file **css/app.css** will be overwritten as changes are made to **scss/app.scss**.
